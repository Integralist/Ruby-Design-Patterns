The Observer pattern allows you to build components that know about the activities of other components 
without having to tightly couple everything together in an unmanageable mess of code-flavored spaghetti. 

By creating a clean interface between the source of the news (the observable object) 
and the consumer of that news (the observers), the Observer pattern moves the news without tangling things up.
